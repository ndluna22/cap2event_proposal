# Project proposal: Event App

1. The tech stack I will use for my final project will be React and Node

2. I will try to make this a full stack application. However, most of the focus might be front-end UI with react. 

3. This will be a website application.

4. The goal for my project is for users to be able to find events by different searches such as the artists, team or even by date and city. 

5. The type of users or demographic would be young adults to older of all genders mostly interested in music, festivals, sports, and media. 

6. I would like to use data provided by an event side API and/or media related API to provide more search possibilities. The data would assist in finding more related events and also what is near the location of the user. This data includes artist, festival, or sports schedules around the area. Also, data regarding the seats in the location and available seating. 

7. 

*a.* The database schema would be separated by event, user, artists, favorites

*b.* The issues I might run in to this API would be outdated or unavailable information for the event or entity the user is searching for. Also, if there is an added seating feature or seating finder, 

*c.* The user's profile and password would need to be secured since it is a part of sensitive information. 

*d.* The user will be able to search and filter through events by artist, team, location, or date if possible. The user can view images and snippets of the artists. The user can also create their own profile with saved searches or if they want to go to an event maybe add in a cart feature to check out. 

*e.* The user flow in the beginning of the site will be to view the search bar and filtering options to search for the event they are looking for. This will then prompt the user to the detail event page and feature all the current events. The user can like or add this to their profile or cart if possible, and can view additional features on the event. The user register,login and logout. 

*f.* There will be added media and image features where the user can see in the home page. This can also be added to the event detail page or additional artist page. Going beyond CRUD and stretch goals would be features where you can like an event/artist, auto-fill and possible cart features.
